We will be creating a PC builder application.

The application will be a web application that will allow users to build a PC, calculates the price of the PC, 
and allows users to click on a button "Add to Cart". This button will log the PC data to the console.

Description:
- All options are provided as an example. They should be removed from html and dynamically created with javascript.
- The user should be able to select a CPU, Motherboard, RAM, GPU, and Storage.
- Add to cart button should be disabled until all options are selected.
- The options should be shown then pressing on the "Pick an Option" button.
- The options should be hidden then pressing on the option choice.
- The selected option should be shown in the paragraph text.
- The option price should be added to the total price.

Requirements:
- Use "data" object to store all initial data.
- Use a dynamic function to create option elements and add them to the DOM.
- Use a dynamic function to create option choice elements and add them to the DOM.

- Use "elements" object to store all elements.
- Elements object should contain newly created option elements.

- Use a "state" object to track "optionValue" and "optionPrice".
- State object should have a "totalPrice" property.
- State object should have two methods "updateTotalPrice" and "checkIfAddToCartIsAvailable".
